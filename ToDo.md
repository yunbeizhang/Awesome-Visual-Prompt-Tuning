## üìù To-Do & Enhancements

This section outlines planned improvements and areas for future expansion of this repository. Contributions are welcome!

* [ ] **Expand Introduction:**
    * [ ] Add a "Motivation/Why VPT?" section highlighting benefits like parameter efficiency, reduced storage, faster adaptation, better generalization potential, and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
* [ ] **Refine Categorization:**
    * [ ] Consider further subdivision for "Token-Level Prompts" (e.g., Input-Level, Attention-Based, Adapter-like) if supported by literature.
* [ ] **Add New Content Sections:**
    * [ ] Create a "Prompt Design Strategies" section (covering prompt length/depth, initialization, sharing/composition).
    * [ ] Add a "Theoretical Underpinnings" section (for papers discussing *why* VPT works).
    * [ ] Develop a more specific "Applications" section (listing tasks like image classification, object detection, segmentation, few-shot learning, medical imaging, etc.).
    * [ ] Include a "Metrics & Evaluation" section (mentioning common evaluation practices and relevant metrics for VPT).
    * [ ] Curate a "Future Directions / Open Problems" section (discussing limitations, open questions like scalability, interpretability, cross-task generalization, combining with other PEFTs).
* [ ] **Improve Readability & Engagement:**
    * [ ] Design and add a simple diagram illustrating different prompt types (pixel vs. token).
    * [ ] Implement a clear Table of Contents in the README for better navigation as the list grows.
* [ ] **Community & Contribution:**
    * [ ] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with clear guidelines for contributions.
